# Cryptocurrency-Analysis-and-Forecasting
This project dives into the world of cryptocurrency by leveraging Power BI for interactive analysis and Python for predictive modeling using the ARIMA algorithm. The study covers trends from January 2024 to November 2024 of 5 cryptocurrencies and explores the future trajectory of one cryptocurrency.

## Project Structure
- Power BI Dashboards: Individual and combined cryptocurrency dashboards with detailed DAX calculations for advanced insights.
- Python Scripts:Scripts for data preprocessing, ARIMA modeling, and forecasting.
- Datasets: Historical cryptocurrency data used for analysis and predictions.
- Visuals: Screenshots of dashboards and Python-generated plots.

## Tools Used
- Python: Utilized Pandas for web scraping, data preprocessing, Statsmodels for ARIMA time series forecasting, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- ARIMA: Applied for Bitcoin price predictions, modeling trends, and seasonality.
- Power BI: Designed interactive dashboards with DAX for advanced analytics and insights.
- Excel: Validated scraped data to ensure consistency before analysis.

## Key Features
